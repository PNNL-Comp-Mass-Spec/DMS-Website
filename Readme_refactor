factors
------------------------------------------

Ability to delete a factor
Ability to rename a factor
Ability to select a range of cells and clear them
Accepting list of dataset IDs as an alternative to dataset names (automatically recognize)
Choosers for getting dataset lists (from a data package might be a useful one)
The usual DMS web page framing (the top-level drop-down menu bar and so forth)
x-Ability to clear all values in a column (effectively deletes that factor, if subsequently saved)
x-Ability to sort rows
x-Accepting tab-delimited text pasted into an upload field (like the current factors web page does)
x-Some automatic sizing of column widths

Ability to rename a factor:
- For each row in data array: 
    add property to row object for new column and copy value from original property
    mark change object for new property and original property (to blank)
    delete original property
- change id,name,field of original column spec and reset colum array
- refresh the grid

allow adding factors from hard metadata

http://prismwebdev2.pnl.gov/dmsref/gen/welcome

Replaced prototype.js and scriptaculous with JQuery and JQueryUI
Cleaned up JS:
	Split code in dms2.js into separate objects (acts as namespaces)
		gamma - general purpose methods
		lambda - list report methods 	
		theta - specialized list report methods (factors)
		delta - detail report methods
		epsilon - entry page methods
		navBar - methods used by drop-down menu bar
	Replaced "GlobalAJAX" with gamma.pageContext object and made usage consistent across modules
	Pulled out common functions from cmd views into central library
	Most all AJAX submissions go through central library 
		Apply common behavior, such as busy indicator
		Link to page-based code via callbacks where possible
Used spin.js instead of animated GIF for "busy" indicator
Can suppress creation of standard entry page command buttons via general_params table in config db
	(INSERT INTO general_params ("name", "value") VALUES ('cmd_buttons', 'suppress');
	Useful when "Easy" pages want to supersede them
Using chosen.js for drop-down choosers on entry pages
	Has built-in field for restricting list by typing in filter values
Replaced scal date picker with one that is built into JQueryUI
