<p>You have selected the 'Closed' state and there is biomaterial associated with this prep request.</p>
<p>Would you like to change the state setting to special 'Closed (containers and material)' setting instead?</p>
<p>This will retire the material and containers that are associated only with this prep request, and the request will be left in the 'Closed' state</p>
